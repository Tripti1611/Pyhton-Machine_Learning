Regression is a Supervised Machine Learning Technique. In regression tasks, the machine learning program must estimate – and understand – the relationships among variables. Regression analysis focuses on one dependent variable and a series of other changing variables – making it particularly useful for prediction and forecasting.

In this notebook I've used Linear Regression to train the model and predict the net worth of a person based on their age.
